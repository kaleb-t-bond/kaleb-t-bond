## Hi, I'm Kaleb 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at WGU (graduating 2026) and an aspiring IT professional. I'm currently building my skills in back-end development (Java, C++), database management, and Linux systems administration. <br>

My goal is to transition into a technical role from my current position in Event Operations, where I've been a part of the SSA team since 2022.
<br>

🌱 What I'm Focusing On: <br>
Systems & Infrastructure: Linux environments, shell scripting, and core networking. <br>
Back-End Development: Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs. <br>
Core CS & Databases: Data Structures, Algorithms, and SQL. <br>
